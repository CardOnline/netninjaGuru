For example, you can type "lorem" and press Tab to insert Lorem Ipsum text. You can also create your own custom snippets in VS Code.

Using Extensions:
There are several extensions available in the Visual Studio Code marketplace that provide Lorem Ipsum or random text generation capabilities. One such extension is called "Lorem Ipsum" by Daniel Imms. To use an extension like this, follow these steps:

Install the "Lorem Ipsum" extension from the Visual Studio Code marketplace.
Once installed, you can open a file and use a keyboard shortcut or a command to generate random text based on your preferences.
You can configure the extension to generate text with specific character counts, paragraphs, or other options.

Manually Typing Random Text:
If you want to insert completely custom random text, you can manually type it using the keyboard. You can type any random text you want, such as gibberish, placeholder text, or any other content.

These methods should help you insert random text in Visual Studio Code based on your needs. The choice of method will depend on your specific requirements for random text insertion.
